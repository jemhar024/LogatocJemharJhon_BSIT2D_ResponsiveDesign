	 	<p>The environment is our immediate surroundings. Pollution of our environment, on the other hand, is environmental pollution. The current state of the planet is the result of centuries of exploitation of the planet and its resources.</p><p>Pollution can harm the ecosystem's physical and biological components. Furthermore, ozone depletion, greenhouse gas emissions, and global warming are all examples of environmental pollution. Furthermore, their consequences may be fatal for future generations. The earth's natural system is affected by the unpredictably cold and hot environment. Man has exploited nature's richness at the expense of his and the environment's health. Furthermore, the quickly growing effect is the result of hundreds or thousands of years of human activity.</p>

			<h3>Reduce Pesticides</h3>
			<p>Always try to minimize your chemical pesticides and herbicides because generally both are very harmful to the environment. Go online or visit gardening stores or landscaping companies in your town to learn about more safer replacements for these products. It can be done quite easily.</p>
			
		</div>
		<div class="program-col">
			<img src="image/solution2.jpg">
			<h3>Reduce, Reuse and Recycle</h3>
			<p>Citizens should reduce the usage of air-conditioners as it will release harmful gases , for instant ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons which will result in reducing air pollution. One may make no difference, but when carried out together, massive changes can be made. Moving on, reuse reusable items like plastic bags, bottles, boxes and more is also one of the way to reduce pollution/p>

			<h3>Reduce, Reduce The Use of Vehicle</h3>
			<p>Reducing the usage of vehicles on road will also help in reducing air pollution on earth. The more the usage of vehicles, the more the harmful gases released into the air such as hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxides, and sulfur dioxides which will cause serious air pollutions. The usage of cars, lorries and motorbikes should be drastically reduced as the gases released by these vehicles can also contribute in green house effect. However, these pollutions can be reduced when citizens practice the habit of car-pooling and the usage of public transport like bus, trains, monorails and many more. In addition, citizens can walk or cycle to near destinations instead of driving which will lead to lesser air pollution. Therefore, reducing the usage of vehicles by no doubt can reduce air and sound pollutions. </p>
